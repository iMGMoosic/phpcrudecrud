# PHP Crude CRUD Application
Does the typical CRUD stuff (create, read, update, delete), and it's not particularly pretty but hey when you're just starting out that's fine, right? A simple webpage so you don't have to dig through the trenches of MySQL is also included.

# What I Did
* Created an Ubuntu virtual machine
* Installed LAMP stack components
* Configured MySQL, added user accounts, loaded sample schema (300,000 records)
* Configured PHP connector and credentials
* Used GitHub to manage code
* Created a tar.gz deployment file and deployed to other VMs
